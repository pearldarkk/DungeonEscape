# DungeonEscape
One silly C++ game i coded. 
Try to escape the dungeon which is full of (not so) dangerous monsters.
This was my university club ISP's task for each of us, so, sorry for its poor graphic.

# Features:
- The big monsters could take your key away.
- Monsters can move.
- (maybe) hardcore if you choose Insane.
- Added some color. (Thanks to [rlutil.h](https://github.com/tapio/rlutil) lib)

# Some bugs:
I've tried to code extra feature (high score records) but there were some bugs with my i/o with file in C++. I'll try to fix it.

# NOTE:
You need the rlutil.h lib to compile the source code successfully.
